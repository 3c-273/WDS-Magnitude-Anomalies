# WDS-Magnitude-Anomalies
Abstract.

Visual magnitude entries in the WDS often differ from those in other catalogs by
a magnitude or more. Using the 2MASS, PPMXL, Tycho, UCAC4, and URAT1 catalogs,
we provide a listings of the WDS entries that have no corresponding entries
in the other catalogs that are within a magnitude (visual band) of the WDS
primary stars' magnitude and are also within 10" of the WDS primary.

Those stars with two digit fractional magnitudes must be within 0.5mv of
the catalog stars. WDS stars that are marked by the WDS as dubious, infrared,
Johnson red band, have no primary visual magnitude, have no precise coordinates,
or are marked as uncertain are not included in this study. All entries in the
lists below were found to have anomalous magnitudes.

The code required to do this study in the file MagnitudeAnomaliesInTheWdsSourceCode.zip
